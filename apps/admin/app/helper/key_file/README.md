# Firebase service account location

Place the Firebase Admin SDK JSON credentials file in this directory with the exact name `sysavings-5ad56-aeb337580e7d.json`.
The notification helper now always reads that file directly (no environment variables), so ensure it contains the service account details you want to use for push notifications.
